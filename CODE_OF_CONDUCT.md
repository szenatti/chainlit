# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

* **Accepting responsibility** and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* **Focusing on what is best** not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community
* **Showing empathy** towards other community members
* **Being patient** with newcomers and those learning
* **Helping others** learn and grow in their Chainlit journey
* **Celebrating diversity** and welcoming contributors from all backgrounds

### Examples of unacceptable behavior:

  any kind

* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Project-Specific Guidelines

### Contributing to Chainlit Solutions

* **Help newcomers**: Remember that everyone was a beginner once. Be patient and helpful when others are learning Chainlit or AI development
* **Respect different skill levels**: Our solutions range from basic to enterprise-level. All skill levels are welcome
* **Be constructive in code reviews**: Provide helpful feedback that helps improve the code and helps the contributor learn
* **Document your contributions**: Help others understand your code and decisions
* **Test thoroughly**: Ensure your contributions work across different platforms and configurations

### Technical Discussions

* **Stay on topic**: Keep discussions relevant to Chainlit, AI development, or the specific solutions in this repository
* **Provide context**: When reporting bugs or requesting features, include relevant details
* **Be solution-oriented**: Focus on finding solutions rather than just pointing out problems
* **Share knowledge**: If you've solved a problem, help others by sharing your solution

### Community Interactions

* **Use inclusive language**: Avoid assumptions about gender, technical background, or experience level
* **Respect time zones**: Remember that our community is global
* **Be patient with responses**: Contributors and maintainers may not respond immediately
* **Use appropriate channels**: GitHub Issues for bugs/features, Discussions for questions, etc.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

This includes:
- GitHub repository interactions (issues, pull requests, discussions)
- Community forums and chat platforms
- Social media interactions related to the project
- Conferences or meetups where the project is discussed
- Email communications related to the project

## Reporting Guidelines

please report it by contacting the project team at [INSERT EMAIL ADDRESS].

All reports will be handled with discretion and confidentiality.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent
ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
community.
